        <!-- Danger of a single story -->
            <h3> Danger of a single story </h3>
            <p> The dangers of a single story video demonstrate how a story can present an unwarranted context or meanings towards many people, some of these meaning be presented as tropes, stereotypes of another, and to create and define a story as the  <span><i> only </i></span> significant one. The story being able to reshape or impact people for either the better or the worse. For myself, I can see how dangerous one single story can be when portraying a person or a group similar to how rumors or baseless accusations would be, it either be used to represent someone or to establish someone as their definition.</p>

        <!-- Four Corners -->   
            <h3> Four Corners </h3>
            <p> The four corners video present four different narratives when it comes to graphic design. It incorporate many different narratives such as making heroes, one that highlights the use of peopleâ€™s rage, one where to depicts several types of politics and the intent of designers that make the designs. I think the video allows us to the see what sort of narratives can be used within design and how it can be presented in said fashion. </p>

            <h3>  Is there a canon of graphic design history? </h3>
            <p> The reading presents if there a canon to what is considered graphic design, it highlights the history on how graphic design is formulated and the general uses it can bring. The reading also tries to uncover who is in the canon and who is not in the canon, to who determines what is canon. Can the canon be mainly just commercial or can it be explored in many different aspects? </p>

        <!-- What does a feminist graphic design history in the United States look like? -->
            <h3> What does a feminist graphic design history in the United States look like? </h3>
            <p> The reading presents how the history of graphic design have tried to hide or yet to uncover women's contributions for graphic design, demostrating that it would have to take more in-depth research to be able to recognize women's contributions towards graphic design. There was a phrase in the reading where it states, the <span><i>"paradigm of oppression has invisible construct,"</i></span> which depicts that women in general or in graphic design history has been always oppressed but isn't seen by the general viewer unless if they were to do further research on the topic. I think the topic is really interesting for myself because at most times, majority of design history would be invisible to myself until I'm either told about some designers or that I would have to research further into the topic.  </p>

            <h3> Sharing as Survival </h3>
            <p> Sharing as Survival presents a Cyberfeminism Index where it contains both present and future resources of works of cyberfeminists such as open sources, crowd sources and open access. The index also present ideals of an anti-canon where it tries to defeat what/who is considered within the canon and creates it's own version where things would go in and out as time progresses. </p>

        <!--Anger is my Motto-->
            <h3> Anger is my Motto </h3>
            <p>  Anger is My Motto pushes the idea of using the feeling of anger develop yourself as a person further, to be able to change your mindset on certain things and perspectives on the things you already have learned. I think its quite unique to use the feeling of anger as a way to motivate yourself because usually the feeling of anger is directed at something or someone in a negative way but in this case, they use it to change themselves which is pretty cool.</p>

        <!--The Feminist Possibilities of Print-->
            <h3>  The Feminist Possibilities of Print </h3>
            <p> The Feminist Possibilities of Print presents an idea where a new concept of female printers would be created, to where new ideals can be placed within a new enviroment, to change up and improve the perspective given to females and their work based on history and generally men. The idea is similar to what is considered canon in graphic design, it tries to make sure that female printers do exist and would try to develop a new canon in a sense where the perspective of females is more noticeable or prominent than it ever was, I think. </p>

            <h3>How to Embed Feminist, Post-colonial + Intersectional Perspectives into Graphic Design AND make it look fun, bold, and excellent in the process</h3>
            <p> I find this text to be an interesting read because it describes what is considered good or bad taste when it comes to graphic design and how we should strive to break apart the template type of style presented in the Western bubble of graphic design. And relating to that idea of breaking aparting the template is similar to what is considered canon in graphic design, which in this case could be the minimal, safe and clean design.</p>

        <!--The Politics of Design-->
            <h3> The Politics of Design</h3>
            <p> The book is really interesting with how to protrays the politics of design and its practices with how it highlights how communication can be really volatile by the way it is presented. The book also entails that it can either serve or subverts the status quo and I would assume that the status quo is the canon of graphic design, and it is really interesting that it goes back to that concept because what is the status quo, and how it can greatly be affected. The book also shows how important communication is within design because it allows the viewer to understand what the designer is trying communicate about and often time, misinterpretations can happen.  </p>

            <h3> The People's Graphic Design Archive</h3>
            <p> After watching the video of the People's Graphic Design Archive and browsing the site itself, I've found a lot of interesting and very different forms of graphic design within the site. Some things I've found range from poster work, in-progress stuff, letters, videos and other forms related to graphic design. Some works that I really found interesting was one called <b> Radioactive Fallout</b> from the The University Museum in Los Angeles because it presented a propaganda vibe and function but works in it's own way where it goes against that. I think it tries to go against the canon or the standard template that most propaganda posters have. </p>
            <p> Another one that I really liked was called <b> Insert Fully Withdraw Quickly </b> by Rick Griffith because it was poking fun or critiquing the consumerism of gas and oil by the US government. The poster also has a similar function to the Uncle Sam We Want You propaganda poster because of the various motifs it contains such as Uncle Sam finger pointing to the viewer.  This piece also contains a type of narrative, and that narrative being either the decolonized counter narrative or the people's history counter narrative. </p>
            <p>I found the <b>Design Magazine Poster from 1970</b> is be really fun to look at and it might have relations to the making graphic design fun article because just looking at the poster presents a really fun feeling to me and it looks nice to look at.</p>
            <p> The fourth one being <b>Sun Mad Raisins</b> is a quite a funny one because it is an adbuster type of poster that addressing problems of the raisin brand of Sun Maid Raisins and also contains a narrative within it as well.</p>

    <h3> On Publishing--Graphic Designers Who Publish</h3>
    <p>Browsing through the publications was quite an interesting interaction to navigate around because the website made it hard to find the texts itself since it kept itself hidden in a way. The way it kept itself hidden is by not functioning as a regular website but more so like a physical publication where you would flip the pages around. The colours of red and blue text kept messing up my eyes, so I would have to re-read it again to make sure that I'm on the right sentences or ideas.</p>
    <p> The five publications I've chosen to compiled are Corners, Feeeels, Inventory Press, NXS and Yellow Pages. Corner was interesting because of the uses of a Risograph into their publication, showing that it helps with the efficiency of producing books and prints. Feeeels addresses the roles of tactility in a digital work through publications. Inventory Press presents design as an underutilized tool by conceptualized and disseminated ways. The uses of collaboration is meant to have a focus to discover topics that are barely talked about and tried to be filled into our history books. NXS is pretty neat with the themes of human identity with relation to the digital realm. Yellow Page is pretty fun and full of memes which is why I like it alot.</p>

        <h3> General Questions</h3>
        <p> What is your view on meta commentary? What kind of meta commentary do you like/dislike and why?</p>
        <p>Relating to the previous question, how does the use of memes can affect politics in a sense? </p>
        <p> Would the term of Data Kulture is in a way another form of an archive?</p>
