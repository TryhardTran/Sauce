        <!-- Danger of a single story -->
            <h3> Danger of a single story </h3>
            <p> The dangers of a single story video demonstrate how a story can present an unwarranted context or meanings towards many people, some of these meaning be presented as tropes, stereotypes of another, and to create and define a story as the <span style="color: blue"> only</span> significant one. The story being able to reshape or impact people for either the better or the worse. For myself, I can see how dangerous one single story can be when portraying a person or a group similar to how rumors or baseless accusations would be, it either be used to represent someone or to establish someone as their definition.</p>
        <!-- Four Corners -->    
            <h3> Four Corners </h3>
            <p> The four corners video present four different narratives when it comes to graphic design. It incorporate many different narratives such as making heroes, one that highlights the use of peopleâ€™s rage, one where to depicts several types of politics and the intent of designers that make the designs. I think the video allows us to the see what sort of narratives can be used within design and how it can be presented in said fashion. </p>
        <!--  Is there a canon is graphic design? -->  
            <h3>  Is there a canon is graphic design? </h3>
            <p> The reading presents if there a canon to what is considered graphic design, it highlights the history on how graphic design is formulated and the general uses it can bring. The reading also tries to uncover who is in the canon and who is not in the canon, to who determines what is canon. Can the canon be mainly just commercial or can it be explored in many different aspects? </p>

        <!-- What does a feminist graphic design history in the United States look like? -->
            <h3> What does a feminist graphic design history in the United States look like? </h3>
            <p> The reading presents how the history of graphic design have tried to hide or yet to uncover women's contributions for graphic design, demostrating that it would have to take more in-depth research to be able to recognize women's contributions towards graphic design. There was a phrase in the reading where it states, the <span style="color:blue">"paradigm of oppression has invisible construct,"</span> which depicts that women in general or in graphic design history has been always oppressed but isn't seen by the general viewer unless if they were to do further research on the topic. I think the topic is really interesting for myself because at most times, majority of design history would be invisible to myself until I'm either told about some designers or that I would have to research further into the topic.  </p>

        <!--Sharing as Survival-->
            <h3> Sharing as Survival </h3>
            <p> The article of Sharing as Survival presents a Cyberfeminism Index where it contains both present and future resources of works of cyberfeminists such as open sources, crowd sources and open access. The index also presents the idea of an anti-canon where it tries to defeat what/who is considered within the canon. </p>
