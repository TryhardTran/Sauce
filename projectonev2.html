        <!-- Danger of a single story -->
            <h3> Danger of a single story </h3>
            <p> The dangers of a single story video demonstrate how a story can present an unwarranted context or meanings towards many people, some of these meaning be presented as tropes, stereotypes of another, and to create and define a story as the <span style="color: blue"> only</span> significant one. The story being able to reshape or impact people for either the better or the worse. For myself, I can see how dangerous one single story can be when portraying a person or a group similar to how rumors or baseless accusations would be, it either be used to represent someone or to establish someone as their definition.</p>
        <!-- Four Corners -->    
            <h3> Four Corners </h3>
            <p> The four corners video present four different narratives when it comes to graphic design. It incorporate many different narratives such as making heroes, one that highlights the use of peopleâ€™s rage, one where to depicts several types of politics and the intent of designers that make the designs. I think the video allows us to the see what sort of narratives can be used within design and how it can be presented in said fashion. </p>
        <!--  Is there a canon is graphic design? -->  
            <h3>  Is there a canon is graphic design? </h3>
            <p> The reading presents if there a canon to what is considered graphic design, it highlights the history on how graphic design is formulated and the general uses it can bring. The reading also tries to uncover who is in the canon and who is not in the canon, to who determines what is canon. Can the canon be mainly just commercial or can it be explored in many different aspects? </p>
