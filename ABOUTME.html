    <!-- BIO -->
        <p> Hi, I am <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Daniel Tran.</span> I am a Treaty 1 Territory (or Winnipeg, Manitoba) based graphic designer on a mission to create unique designs while maintaining various design ethics and standards. <br>My interest in design began in my late days of high school when I was inspired by the aesthetics of minimalistic graphic design. Naturally, I had no idea what I was doing when it came to designing something but overtime improvement would come. Majority of my projects contains a very satire feeling to it, mixed with a combination of the standard graphic design standards. Why satire? Satire is an interesting and funny concept that I really enjoy, perhaps due to internet memes and it built in a personality trait in me. I also enjoy doing professional and work like creating email materials, graphic assets, and posters for student groups and companies.         My next goal as a designer is exploring a more unique and expressive style because I feel like I have a decent understanding of design in general but I would like to go even further beyond in the expressive and contemporary area.</p>
