        <p> A website as an analogy, I think for myself a website can be seen as a deckbox. A deckbox is mainly a protective case that protects your slightly expensive trading cards from getting crushed or damaged from the outside forces. The reason why I would compare a website to a deckbox is because both are a protective being in a sense where it protects or shelters the contents inside it. A website would shelter the contents by layering it with various secuirty software or VPNs, hiding content under layers with the use of coding. A deckbox would also come with various different built qualities from plastic to leather to sometimes wood, to the choice of colour is similar to how stylized a website can become through the uses of CSS and the way you would handle your HTML.</p> 
        <p>The cards inside of the deckbox can act as the content you would put on your website such as images, videos and etc, you would put content in and take them out, similar to how when you want to play a match or a round or two, you would take your cards out of the deckbox and interact with them.</p>
        <p> Other ideas that sprung with deck boxes is the idea of adding friction to the website, how accessible do you want the website to be? Similar to how secure you want the deckbox to be in order to hold your cards.</p>
