    <!-- GROUND -->
        <p> At first, the theme of “ground” drew me into the project by giving me many options to define what “ground” is to me. Initially, when the theme of “ground” was first brought up, the train of humorous things and puns went straight to my head then it somewhat clicked that I should play with the word and meaning of “ground” around, to set it down and let it expand into many things, which is something I want to do. <br>
            The thing I hope to accomplish is setting new ground for myself, to show that I can do this which would allow me to be more confident in myself and work. I also want to do some other cool things relating to graphic design such as developing multiple different styles for each poster and allowing interactions between them.  <br>
